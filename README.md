# Gramex

Very basic and feature-incomplete Telegram bot API helpers.

⚠️ Definitely not ready for production.

## Conventions

Currently, the library relies on your User schema having the following fields: telegram_id, telegram_username, telegram_first_name, telegram_last_name, telegram_language_code.
The first stable release will allow providing mapping from your User schema to Telegram fields.
